# Employee-Tracker
### Description
For this challenge, my goal was to create a content management system that allows non-developer users to interact with databases. The user will go through a series of command line prompts to build their departments, and recieve a neatly formatted database with all their employee and department information. This is done through a command line application built with Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
